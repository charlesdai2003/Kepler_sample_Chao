# Kepler_sample_Chao
New repo containing some of my work for the challenge question response from Kepler.


The old header file from Istuary talked about in Question 1 A is in the folder named Istuary. The folders named Lab2-6 contains previous work in my Computer Hardware Course from UofT. These files might not be the final versions of themselves and may not work as I have lost the final versions due to a hard drive failure.

The other files are from my homework in Hardware Description Languages for FPGA Design - University of Colorado Boulder for the VLSI HDL.
